The requirements below must be met before merging, but not for opening a PR. 
Feel free to open a draft PR early - we're happy to help and provide suggestions on how to address these requirements. 

- You must add tests when making code changes. This keeps the code coverage level up, and helps ensure the changes work as intended.
- When fixing a bug, you must add a test that would produce the bug in the master branch, and then show that it is fixed with the new code. 
- New code additions must be well formatted. Changes should pass the pre-commit workflow, which you can set up locally using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#intro). 
- Docstring additions must render correctly, including escapes and LaTeX.
