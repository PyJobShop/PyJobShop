    "\n",
    "- There is a set of $n$ jobs that need to be processed in a series of stages.\n",
    "- The number of processing stages is at least 2.\n",
    "- Each stage has at least one machine in parallel, and in at least one stage there is more than one machine.\n",
    "- All jobs are processed in the same production order: production starts in stage 1, then stage 2, etc. until the last stage. A job can only start processing when it has finished processing in the previous stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below illustrates a small HFS manufacturing environment. The first stage has three machines, the second stage has two machines, and the third stage has also two machines. Each machine name $M_{kl}$ describes the stage $k$ and $l$-th machine in the stage. The machines in each stage are identical, meaning that each machine has the same processing speed for a given job.\n",
