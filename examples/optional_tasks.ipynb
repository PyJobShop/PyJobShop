    "\n",
    "This notebook showed how to model scheduling problems with optional tasks in PyJobShop. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optional tasks: Set `optional=True` when creating tasks to let the solver decide whether to schedule them.\n",
    "- Selection constraints: Use `SelectAllOrNone`, `SelectAtLeastOne`, and `SelectExactlyOne` to control task selection.\n",
    "- Conditional selection logic: The `condition_task` parameter enables \"if-then\" relationships between tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These capabilities enable modeling of alternative process plans, flexible project structures, and complex scheduling scenarios where not all tasks need to be executed."
