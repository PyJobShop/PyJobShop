Introduction to constraint programming
======================================

Outline
-------

* What is Constraint Programming?

  * Definition of Constraint Programming (CP)
  * Comparison with other solving paradigms (e.g., linear programming, SAT solvers)

* How does it work?

  * Basic components

    * Variables
    * Domains of variables
    * Constraints

  * Constraint propagation

    * Arc-consistency
    * Domain reduction techniques

  * Search algorithms

    * Backtracking
    * Branch and bound
    * Heuristics for variable and value selection

* CP for Scheduling

  * Interval variables

* Tools and Libraries for Constraint Programming

  * Overview of popular CP solvers

    * Google OR-Tools
    * CP Optimizer

  * Alternative that don't have interval variables

* Further Reading and Resources

  * Books and papers on constraint programming
  * Online courses and tutorials
  * [CP-SAT Primer](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer): a great introduction book to Google OR-Tools' CP-SAT solver. This book will help you to get familiar with OR-Tools' basics.
  * [Discrete Optimization Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization): module 3 covers constraint programming by Pascal van Hentenryck.
