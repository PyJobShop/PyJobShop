PyJobShop is a Python library for solving scheduling problems with constraint programming.
It currently supports the following scheduling problems:

- **Resource environments:** single machines, parallel machines, hybrid flow shops, open shops, job shops, flexible job shops, renewable resources and non-renewable resources.
- **Constraints:** release dates, deadlines, due dates, multiple modes, sequence-dependent setup times, no-wait, blocking, and arbitrary precedence constraints.
- **Objective functions:** minimizing makespan, total flow time, number of tardy jobs, total tardiness, total earliness, maximum tardiness and maximum lateness.

You can find PyJobShop on the Python Package Index under the name ``pyjobshop``.
To install it, simply run:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install pyjobshop


.. hint::

    If you are new to scheduling or constraint programming, you might benefit from first reading the :doc:`introduction to scheduling <setup/intro_to_scheduling>` and :doc:`introduction to CP <setup/intro_to_cp>` pages.
    To set up an installation from source, or to run the examples listed below yourself, please have a look at the :doc:`installation instructions <setup/installation>`.
