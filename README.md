PyJobShop is a package for implementing scheduling models in Python.
It supports the classically known *flexible job shop problem* (FJSP) and many of its extensions such as arbitrary precedence relations, sequence-dependent setup times, and many more!
The implementation is currently work in progress - feel free to open an issue if you have any questions.


## Installation
First, clone this repository to your local setup and `cd` into it. 
Then, make sure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) version 1.2+ installed, and run the following command:

``` shell
poetry install
```

This will set-up a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies. 

### Installing CPLEX
Running the CP model and solving it requires the optimization engine from IBM CPLEX. 
See [their documentation](http://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/docplex-doc/getting_started.html#setting-up-an-optimization-engine) for more details.
If you install the free community edition, you can only solve models with up to 1000 variables and 1000 constraints.
Models beyond that size require a paid version or an academic version.
